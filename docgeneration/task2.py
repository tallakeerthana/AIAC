# Critical comparison of documentation styles
#
# 1. Docstrings
#    Advantages: They stay with the function, are easy to read, and can be
#    displayed by help() or a code editor.
#    Disadvantages: A short docstring may leave out details about parameters
#    and return values.
#    Suitable use: Small functions and beginner-level programs.
#
# 2. Inline comments
#    Advantages: They explain a specific line exactly where it appears.
#    Disadvantages: They do not provide a standard place for describing every
#    parameter, return value, or possible error. They can also become outdated.
#    Suitable use: Explaining a short, complex, or unusual line of code.
#
# 3. Google-style documentation
#    Advantages: It organizes parameters and return values in a consistent
#    format, making the function easier to understand and search.
#    Disadvantages: It takes more effort to write and may be too detailed for
#    a very small private function.
#    Suitable use: Shared functions, team projects, and public APIs.
#
# Recommendation
# Google-style documentation is the most helpful for new developers joining a
# project. It gives them a predictable structure for understanding inputs and
# outputs without needing to study the implementation first. Consistent
# sections also make it easier to learn many functions quickly. Inline comments
# can still be used for any confusing line inside the function."""Problem 2: Documentation styles for a simple login function."""
