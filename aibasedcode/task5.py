# Strengths of AI Suggestions
# Generates code quickly.
# Helps create classes and functions.
# Reduces coding time.
# Provides a basic structure that can be manually improved.
# Limitations
# AI-generated code may contain logical errors.
# The programmer must test the code.
# AI may not always handle all edge cases.
# The generated code should be understood before using it.
# Reflection

# AI-assisted coding improves productivity by providing code suggestions quickly and helping programmers create a basic solution. However, the programmer must verify, test, and understand the generated code before using it.
