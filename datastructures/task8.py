# | Shopping Cart Management | **Deque**          | A deque allows products to be added or removed from either end efficiently.                                 |
# | Order Processing         | **Queue**          | Orders need to be processed in the order they were placed, so FIFO is suitable.                             |
# | Top-Selling Products     | **Priority Queue** | Products can be prioritized according to their sales count so highly ranked products can be accessed first. |
# | Product Search Engine    | **BST**            | A BST can organize products by product ID and support searching based on the ID.                            |
# | Delivery Route Planning  | **Graph**          | Warehouses and delivery locations can be represented as vertices connected by routes/edges.                 |
